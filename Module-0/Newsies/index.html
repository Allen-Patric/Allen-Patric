        <h1 class='title'>Elon Musk’s week of pot smoking and wild emails, explained</h1>

        <h2>The Tesla CEO doubled down on pedophilia accusations in an email to BuzzFeed and smoked pot on Joe Rogan’s podcast.</h2>
<h3>
   <p>Just as the dust had settled in Elon Musk’s will-he-won’t-he take Tesla private drama, the electric car company ran into a new set of troubles. Much of the turmoil was driven by the chief executive himself.</p>

<p> Here’s what happened: On Tuesday, BuzzFeed News published emails from Musk doubling down on his insistence that one of the Thai cave rescuers was indeed a pedophile who had moved to Thailand to take a child bride.
 (The rescuer has denied all of this, and Musk previously apologized for the accusation back in June.)</p>

<p>Then on Thursday, Musk appeared on comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast for a two-hour conversation in which he smoked what Rogan said was marijuana and drank whiskey. On Friday, two of Tesla’s top executives resigned. 
The US Air Force, which has multiple contracts with Musk’s SpaceX, reportedly began looking into Musk’s marijuana use, because it’s prohibited for someone with a government security clearance. 
The Air Force denied there’s an investigation and said it needs to determine “the facts and the appropriate process to handle the situation.”
</p>
<p>Tesla’s share price on Friday fell to almost its lowest point for the year.</p>

<p>But shareholders have stayed engaged — despite Tesla’s production delays, cash troubles, and other setbacks — thanks in large part to the cult of Elon Musk.
 A lot of people believe in the South African-born entrepreneur’s genius and admire his off-the-cuff nature, and so they’re willing to give him leeway where they wouldn’t other executives.
 </p>

<p>Tesla’s board seems aware of it, so they’ve kept him on — even as his behavior gets increasingly erratic. At some point, the question becomes: How much are investors and the board willing to tolerate? 
CEO and chair of General Motors Mary Barra would almost certainly be out of a job or at least reprimanded at GM, at what point is it too much from Musk?
