/* Write a program that has a shopper object. Include at least one property with each of the following data types as values to the properties

String
Number
Boolean
Function (called a "method" when it's inside an object like this. Check out an example for help writing your own)
In addition, you should add a groceryCart property to your object, which should be an Array of items that can commonly be found in a grocery cart.

Starter code:

var shopper = {
   ... your properties will go here
*/

var shopper = {
    name: "AP",
    age: 23,
    hairColor: "Black",
    isAlive: true
} ;

var milk = 'almond';

var budget = 100;

var isdelicious = true

var grocerylist = ['eggs', 'vegan-sausage', 'self-respect', 'discipline']
for (var i = 0; i < cast.length; i++) {
    console.log(i)
    console.log(cast[i]);
    
  }
